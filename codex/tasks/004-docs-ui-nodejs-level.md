Task: Present docs UI with Node.js-level polish

Scope:
- Repo: AIMAS-UI only
- Compose layout, typography, and metadata surfaces

Requirements:
- Provide section counts, source paths, and toc sidebar info
- Ensure UI remains read-only (no editing controls)
- Keep components framework-agnostic (no custom protocol logic)

Output:
- File diffs only
- No prose
