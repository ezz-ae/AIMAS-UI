Task: Landing that proves protocol distinction without explanation

Scope:
- Repo: AIMAS-UI only
- / is search-only input that routes to /search

Requirements:
- Gate search component with single input + CTA to /search
- /search hosts intent input, search results, and “enter system” button
- Ensure copy avoids persuasion; emphasize structural flow (Landing → Search → System)

Output:
- File diffs only
- No prose
