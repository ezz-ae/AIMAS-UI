Fairness Enforcement (F-Law)
---------------------------
- Free Baseline Path is mandatory in every Fit Matrix.
- No ranking, persuasion, or optimization heuristics.
- Time compression, certainty, and guarantees are deterministic outputs.
- Monetization never depends on visibility or attention.
- If fairness cannot be enforced structurally, halt the task.
