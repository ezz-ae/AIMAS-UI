Zero-Leakage Law
----------------
Raw Input (L0) → Ephemeral Normalization → Intent Capsule (L1) → Deterministic Evaluation → Fit Matrix → Fulfillment Paths.

Constraints:
- Raw text must never persist beyond normalization.
- Derived capsules are append-only and opaque; identity is non-transferable.
- Every output must contain ≥1 Free Baseline Path.
- No component may bypass the Fairness Gate or store raw intent.
- Memory is re-effective (supersede, never delete).

Codex must abort any task that introduces leakage or violates this chain.
