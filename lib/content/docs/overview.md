subtitle: "What AIMAS is — and what it refuses to be."

AIMAS is a **fair deep-value engine**. It is not ads. Not recommendations. Not attention.

It computes **certainty** and returns a **Fit Matrix**.

**Output is not a list. Output is a declaration.**

## Two surfaces

- Landing: proves the distinction by experience.
- Dashboard (XUI): executes deterministic protocol output.

## Invariant

Every output includes at least one **Free Baseline Path**.
